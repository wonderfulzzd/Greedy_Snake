This is a greedy snake game running in a terminal. It is the first greedy snake game program that supports both Windows and Linux! Try it out!

The purpose of this project is just to get familar with terminal interaction through C++ programming. 
Besides, it is to help practice makefile, cmake, and github functionalities. Further improvements may be added gradually. 

Thank you!
