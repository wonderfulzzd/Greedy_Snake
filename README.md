This is a greedy snake game running in a terminal.

The purpose of this project is just to get familar with terminal interaction through C++ programming. 
Besides, it is to help practice makefile and github functionalities.

This is the first greedy snake game program that supports both Windows and Linux! Try it out!

Further improvements may be added gradually. Thank you!
